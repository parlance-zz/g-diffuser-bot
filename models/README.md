- *** IMPORTANT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ***
- If you are using a hugging-face access token you do not need to worry about anything here, you should be good to go!

- If you would prefer to use pre-downloaded model weights, sign up for a hugging-face account at https://huggingface.co/ and accept the terms of use for the model repositories of your choice:
	- Download or clone models from https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers e.g.:
	    - https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4
	    - https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion
	- Download with git: "git clone https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
	- Place the downloaded folder into this models folder such that the final path would be for example "g-diffuser-lib/models/stable-diffusion-v1-4"

- The selection of models to load other model-specific settings are located in g_diffuser_config_models.yaml
